@Program : let, const and var

#problem Statement : 
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some 
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never 
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

const country = 'India';
const continent='Asia';

console.log(language,country,continent,isIsland);
