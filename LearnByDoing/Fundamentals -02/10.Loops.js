/*
@ Loop
1. There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters. 
Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to 
the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting'

*/

for(var i = 0; i <50; i++) {
    console.log(`voters number ${i} is currently voting`);
}
 


/*

@while loop 
1. Recreate the challenge from the lecture 'Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing', 
but this time using a while loop (call the array 'percentages3')
2. Reflect on what solution you like better for this task: the for loop or the while
loop?
